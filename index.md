Vritra Networks is a figment of my imagination. Some day if I start an IT consultancy firm of my own this is what I’d call it. I had spent a long time thinking up of names but never had any luck until one day this name popped into my head and luckily the domain names etc. were available and so I started using it everywhere. 

The name is a pun on the network monitoring company [ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/). Non-Indians may not be aware of it but the name Thousand Eyes is a reference to the King of Gods Indra. 

Legend has it that Indra, who was a bit of a ladies-man as most King of the Gods seem to be (example: Zeus), took fancy to the beautiful Ahalya, wife of Sage Gautam. She didn’t give in to him, so again as the Gods are won’t to do he shape-shifted to appear as Sage Gautam and when the real Sage Gautam was out of the house Indra appeared in his form and made love to Ahalya. During the course of their love-making she realised something was not right but didn’t do much about it. 

Meanwhile the real Sage Gautam returned home unexpectedly to find his wife in bed with an imposter. Seeing him Ahalya realised what had happened, and Indra was caught red-handed. The angry Sage cursed Indra for his obsession with women to have a 1000 vaginas all over his body (yikes!). 

Ashamed of this Indra went into hiding and that put matters in heaven into turmoil as the King was no longer present. All the Gods thus went to Lord Brahma (the creator) and asked him to intervene. Brahma appealed to Sage Gautam, and while the latter could not reverse the curse (it’s an odd thing, a curse once made cannot be reversed only modified) he modified it such that the 1000 vaginas became 1000 eyes (coz they look similar, get it?). Thus Indra is also known as the God with Thousand Eyes. 

I wanted to put a spin on this for my name.
